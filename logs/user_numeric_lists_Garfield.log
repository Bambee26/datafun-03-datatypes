2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Lists 3. Lists - Using Python Built-in Functions
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 The highest Sparky's weight was: 100.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 The lowest Sparky weighed was: 93.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 There are 24 number of weigh-ins on this list.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 If we add all of Sparky's weigh-ins together, the sum is 2305.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Over the last 24 months, Sparky's average weight was 96.04.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Sparky's goal weight: {'lbs', 94}
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 If we sort all of Sparky's weights in order from lowest to highest: [93, 93, 93, 94, 94, 94, 94, 95, 95, 95, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 97, 97, 97, 98, 99, 99, 99, 99, 100].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 If we sort the weights from highest to lowest: [100, 99, 99, 99, 99, 98, 97, 97, 97, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 95, 95, 94, 94, 94, 94, 93, 93, 93].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 

2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Lists 4. List Methods
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 If we append our month's list with 13, we get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 We can also combine that list with a new list of 14, 15 and 16 to get: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 We can insert a new value of 42 to the list to get [42, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Now we'll remove the 42 because it doesn't fit this list and we get: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Back to Sparky's list. The number 97 appears in the weight list 3 times.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 The weights in ascending order are None.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 The weights in descending order are None.
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Sparky's new weight list is: [100, 99, 99, 99, 99, 98, 97, 97, 97, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 95, 95, 94, 94, 94, 94, 93, 93, 93].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Popped the first (index=0): 100 and now, the weights are: [99, 99, 99, 99, 98, 97, 97, 97, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 95, 95, 94, 94, 94, 94, 93, 93, 93].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 Popped the last item: 93 and now, the weights are: [99, 99, 99, 99, 98, 97, 97, 97, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 95, 95, 94, 94, 94, 94, 93, 93].

2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 These were Sparky's weigh-ins over 97 lbs: [100, 99, 99, 99, 99, 98].
2023-05-26 14:23:37,322 If we take the cube root of each weigh in, we get: [4.64, 4.63, 4.63, 4.63, 4.63, 4.61, 4.59, 4.59, 4.59, 4.58, 4.58, 4.58, 4.58, 4.58, 4.56, 4.56, 4.56, 4.55, 4.55, 4.55, 4.55, 4.53, 4.53, 4.53]
